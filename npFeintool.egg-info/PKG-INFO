Description: # npFeintool
        
        This npFeintool python Package is developed for Feintool data processing. 
        npFeintool package contributes to the preprocessing, **time series data segmentation**, **trend detection**,etc.
        And more features and methods will be added into this repository.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        What things you need to install the software and how to install them
        
        ```
        sklearn
        pandas
        numpy
        nptdms
        matplotlib.pyplot
        matplotlib.mlab 
        
        pip install $name_of_module
        ```
        
        ### Installing
        
        A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
        
        Say what the step will be
        
        ```
        pip install npFeintool(to do)
        ```
        
        
        End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
        
        ## Running the tests
        
        run the `test.py` in the repository `.\example\test.py`
        
        
        
        ### And coding style tests
        
        Explain what these tests test and why
